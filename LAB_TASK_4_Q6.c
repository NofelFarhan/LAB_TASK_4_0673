Question 6: 
To drive traffic during the slow lunch-hour dip, the shop offers a special 10% discount between 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM (11 to 14 in 24-hour time).
 Write a program that reads the current total bill and the current time of day as an integer hour (0-23). 
 Using logical comparisons, check if the hour falls within the promo window [11, 14] inclusive. 
 If it is, deduct 10% from the total and print the discounted total. If not, print the original bill with no discounts.
